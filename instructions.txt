Dual-Branch Architecture:

One branch processes high-quality images (the teacher model) and the other processes low-quality images (the student model).
The teacher model is trained first on high-quality datasets, and the student model learns from low-quality images using a gradient-guided transfer mechanism.
Grad-CAM-Based Attention:

Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is used to apply spatial attention, focusing the student model on important facial regions (like eyes and mouth) to improve recognition under degraded conditions.
Gradient Texture Alignment (GTA):

This technique aligns the gradient-based texture details between the teacher and student models. Gram matrices are used to preserve the structural information of gradient maps, improving the texture alignment across different image qualities.
SA-TG Loss (Soft-Attention Texture-Guided Loss):

This loss function combines gradient texture alignment with attention-based refinement to help the student model retain fine-grained texture details despite image degradation.
Rank-1, Rank-5, CMC (Cumulative Match Characteristics) Evaluation:

Evaluation metrics such as Rank-1, Rank-5 accuracy, and CMC curves are used to assess the performance of the face recognition model. These metrics measure how well the model ranks the correct identity among the top predictions (Rank-1) and among the top 5 or more predictions (Rank-5).
