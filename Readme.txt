This script is a PyTorch-based deep learning pipeline that involves Knowledge Distillation and Texture-Guided Learning for training a ResNet-50 model. Below is a breakdown of its key components:

1. Data Preprocessing
Image Degradation: Applies Gaussian blur and brightness reduction to simulate low-quality images.
Data Transformations:
High-Quality Transform: Resizes image to (224, 224) and converts it to a tensor.
Low-Quality Transform: Applies degradation first, then resizes and converts to a tensor.
Dataset Loading: Uses ImageFolder (CIFAR-10 dataset as an example).
Splitting Dataset: 80% Training, 20% Validation.
DataLoaders: Created for both training and validation sets.
2. Model Definition
Implements a ResNet-50-based architecture (ATAL_ResNet) with a modified fully connected layer for classification.
Initializes Teacher and Student models.
3. Loss Functions
Cross-Entropy Loss (ce_loss): Standard loss for classification.
Knowledge Distillation Loss (kd_loss):
Uses KL Divergence to transfer knowledge from the Teacher model to the Student model.
Texture-Guided Loss (tg_loss):
Uses the Gram Matrix to align texture features between Student and Teacher models.
4. Training the Teacher Model
Function: train_teacher()
Optimizer: Adam
Process:
Forward pass through the Teacher Model.
Compute Cross-Entropy Loss.
Backpropagation and update model weights.
Print training loss.
5. Training the Student Model
Function: train_student()
Optimizer: Adam
Process:
Forward pass through the Teacher Model (in evaluation mode).
Forward pass through the Student Model.
Compute:
Cross-Entropy Loss
Knowledge Distillation Loss
Texture-Guided Loss
Backpropagation and update Student Model.
Print training loss.
6. Model Evaluation
Function: evaluate_model()
Process:
Passes validation data through the Student Model.
Computes Accuracy.
Prints Validation Accuracy.
